The railway reservation system i want to create is basically for the staffs and it should be able to print their ticket with the staff no on it and also to generate a map that can maybe keep track of the routes being included in a staff ticket
Basic features: Login, registration, 
                 The user should select the the train he wants to use i.e source and destination( Ota - ibdadan) 
                 he should be able to choose no of seats he wants to reserve
                 Home page that describes the railway company
                 Contact page where users can lay suggestion or complaints
